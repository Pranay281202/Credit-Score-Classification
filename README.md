# Credit-Score-Classification
Welcome to my Credit Score Classification project! This project demonstrates my proficiency in constructing and evaluating machine learning models to predict individual credit scores accurately. Implemented in a Jupyter Notebook, I utilized Python along with essential machine learning libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Plotly.
The dataset employed is a simulated collection of individual profiles and their associated credit scores, forming the basis for training and evaluating diverse machine learning models.

The project begins with an in-depth exploratory data analysis, uncovering valuable insights into the dataset's nuances and establishing connections between various features and credit scores. 
This understanding guides the subsequent data preprocessing steps to ensure optimal model training conditions.

The model training phase involves multiple algorithms, including Decision Tree and Random Forest.
Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are employed to assess each model's performance, facilitating the selection of the most effective one.

In the final stage, the chosen model is applied to predict credit scores for new, unseen data, and its performance is thoroughly evaluated. Visualizations play a crucial role in providing additional insights into the model's effectiveness.

This project serves as a testament to my ability to navigate real-world data, conduct insightful exploratory data analysis, construct and evaluate machine learning models, and make informed decisions based on the results. I am confident that this showcase will impress hiring managers, highlighting my expertise in the realm of machine learning and data science.
